# Resume Builder Assistant
- This tool was made to assist users not familiar with JSON to create a resume using Slade Berryman's resume builder
- Berryman's resume builder complete with detailed instructions can be found after following this link https://github.com/sladeberryman/resume

# Instructions 
- This website will ask for information commonly found on a resume and generate a JSON file
- WARNING this JSON file, titled "resume" will be automatically downloaded when submitting the information
- This file is downloaded so that the format of "resume" is not compromised when recieving the results of your input

- Open my website by following my link on the right side of my repository and fill out the information as you see fit
- When done, click "Generate Resume"
- This will download the file to use in Berryman's resume bulder
- Navigate to Berryman's website by following this link https://github.com/sladeberryman/resume
- Follow Berryman's instructions except now, instead of modifying the "resume.json" in the repository by hand, users can clear the whole document of its contents and paste the entire contents of the downloaded document from this resume building tool into the same "resume.json"
- This will hopefully streamline the resume buiding process, especially for users unfamiliar with JSON syntax
